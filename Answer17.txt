To sort a stack using a temporary stack follow the following algorithm :
1) Create a temporary stack say tmpStack.
2) While input stack is NOT empty do this:
	i) Pop an element from input stack call it temp
	ii) while temporary stack is NOT empty and top of temporary stack is greater than temp,
	pop from temporary stack and push it to the input stack
	iii) push temp in temporary stack
3) The sorted numbers are in tmpStack
