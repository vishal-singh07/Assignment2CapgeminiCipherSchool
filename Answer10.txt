The applications of graph data structures are as follows:
1) Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road connecting two vertices is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation system is based on the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two vertices.
2) In Facebook, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then there is an edge running between them. Facebookâ€™s Friend suggestion algorithm uses graph theory. Facebook is an example of undirected graph.
3) In Computer science graphs are used to represent the flow of computation.
