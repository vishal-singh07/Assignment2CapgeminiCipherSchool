The simplest way to detect a memory leak is also the way you’re most likely to find one: running out of memory. That’s also the worst way to discover a leak! Before you run out of memory and crash your application, you’re likely to notice your system slowing down. If you do, it can be time to start digging into your code to figure out just what’s using up all your RAM.
Another method for memory leak detection is to use logging intelligently. Sometimes, faulty code doesn’t cause a memory leak, but your users do. Maybe a user has uploaded a very large file that they’re trying to access on your servers. If you’re loading that entire file into memory, you might exhaust the application’s memory through no fault of your own. Mature software organizations will often use automated tools to detect memory leaks in running applications.
