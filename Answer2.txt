Some of the data structures and its applications are as follows:
1. Arrays : Arrays are the simplest data structures that stores items of the same data type in a continuous memory location.

Its applications are as follows :
	i)Web pages can be accessed using the previous and the next URL links which are linked using linked list.
	ii)The music players also use the same technique to switch between music.
3. Stacks : A stack is a data structure which uses LIFO order.
Its applications are as follows :
	i)Converting infix to postfix expressions.
	ii)Undo operation is also carried out through stacks.
4. Queue : A queue is a data structure which uses FIFO order.
Its applications are as follows :
	i)Operating System uses queue for job scheduling.
	ii)To handle congestion in networking queue can be used.
