Some of the most important applications of a Stack are as follows :
1) Expression Handling : The stack can be used to convert some infix expression into its postfix equivalent, or prefix equivalent. These postfix or prefix notations are used in computers to express some expressions. These expressions are not so much familiar to the infix expression, but they have some great advantages also. We do not need to maintain operator ordering, and parenthesis. After converting into prefix or postfix notations, we have to evaluate the expression to get the result. For that purpose, also we need the help of stack data structure.
2) Backtracking : Backtracking is one of the algorithm designing technique. For that purpose, we dive into some way, if that way is not efficient, we come back to the previous state and go into some other paths. To get back from current state, we need to store the previous state. For that purpose, we need stack. Some examples of backtracking is finding the solution for Knight Tour problem or N-Queen Problem etc.
3) Recursion : Recursion is a process where a function iteratively calls itself until a base case is reached. An example of recursion is finding the fatorial of a number.
