Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree which keeps the keys in a sorted order for fast lookup.The value of the nodes in the left subtree are less than or equal to the value of the root node, and the nodes to the right subtree have values greater than or equal to the value of the root node.Binary Search Tree allows for fast for searching an elements stored in the tree as each node key is thoroughly compared with the root node, which discards half of the tree.
