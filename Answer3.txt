Advantages of linked lists over arrays are as follows:
1)Less Memory wastage due to dynamic memory allocation: The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage, and in practical uses, upper limit is rarely reached.
2)Insertion and deletion is easy in linked list : Insertion/deletion  of an element at beginning in a linked list is O(1) operation while in array it is O(n).
