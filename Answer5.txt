Each node of a doubly linked lists have two pointers which contains the address of both previous and next node. Due to this it has its own usages over singly linked list. Its usages are as follows:
1) It is can be used to implement stacks as well as heaps and binary trees whereas Singly linked list are generally used for implementation of stacks.
2) It allows two way traversal.
